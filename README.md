This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Other Information

This template is equipped with TailwindCSS, Mantine UI, the NextJS /src Folder with app router, and a lib folder. 
Inside the lib folder is a file called utils.ts, this file holds a function called cn which allows you to merge together tailwind styles, and css modules.
This is the exact same cn from shadcn/ui's lib folder, and it is also the exact same code.
